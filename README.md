# About This Project

This repository contains tools I am developing as a volunteer for Saint Martin de Porres Catholic Church, Prosper TX to help our parish community easily find things.

## üôè Volunteer Initiative

As a member of our parish community, I am creating these tools to:
- Make it easier for parishioners to stay informed about upcoming events

- Provide a simple, accessible way to share with others
- Support our Parish Office in spreading awareness about these important sessions
